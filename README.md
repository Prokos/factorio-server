# Factorio Server

Make sure to first copy or rename `server-settings-example.json` to `server-settings.json` and set this up as you'd like.

Also, by default the server will expect a world save file called `save.zip` in `saves/`.

## Building the Dockerfile

Run `./build.sh`

## Running the Docker image
